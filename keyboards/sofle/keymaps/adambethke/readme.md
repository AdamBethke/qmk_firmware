# Custom keymap for Sofle Keyboard

Based on the default keymap, with adjustments to make my workflow easier. Layout in [Keyboard Layout Editor]() and [adjust layer](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/4bcf66f922cfd54da20ba04905d56bd4)

Changes:

- Swaps LHS tab/shift keys
- Moves all function keys to top row of `[_LOWER]`
- RHS is master (USB-C plug in on RHS)
- Encoders:
  - RHS encoder is previous track / next track (push is play/pause)
  - Tweaks encoder resolutions
